# encode-decode

Short python program that takes as input a message from user ('a'..'z', '.', ' ')
and uses pictures (.jpg) of alphabet to "encode" the message in destination folder.

Output is thus a folder with copies of the pictures in random order.
Once decoded, pictures are renamed to be in the right order and reveal the message.

Created and tested on Linux.
